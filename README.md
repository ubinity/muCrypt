# muCrypt

micro BigNumber arithmetic library for cryptography, based on
Montgomery arithmetic.

micro Crypto library.

Pending code:

 - ECC
 - RSA

Goals:
 - secure code with "side channel attack" counteracts
 - 8 bits to 32 bits architectures
 - ....
 
Note: Parts of code are inspired of micro-ecc and GMP libraries.

Alfa stage.
